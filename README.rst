``obs`` is a service to pass messages between consumers (e.g., Google Hangouts) and message brokers (e.g., `mosquitto <http://mosquitto.org>`_).

Currently used with ``mosquito`` as a message broker for passing messages between IRC (via ZNC modules) and Google Hangouts (two-way IRC on for your phone).
